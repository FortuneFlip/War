## Reflection Response
Our team found the agile methodology particularly effective in aligning our progress and ensuring cohesive communication. Throughout the project, we utilized Slack for regular updates, especially as we approached key milestones. When working remotely, Zoom meetings and screen sharing proved invaluable for troubleshooting and real-time collaboration. Nevertheless, we recognized that face-to-face interactions facilitated quicker updates and better coordination, enhancing overall collaboration and minimizing conflicts.

In terms of our Scrum board usage, we faced challenges in breaking tasks into very small components due to uncertainty around our final ideas and visualizations. This made maintaining a detailed Scrum board somewhat difficult. However, we managed to divide tasks effectively based on functionality and page style, with these divisions communicated both verbally and online. Despite the less than optimal maintenance of our Scrum board, our approach allowed us to manage tasks according to their functionality and design elements.

Our prioritization strategy focused on developing the core functionality of all pages for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first. This foundational work enabled us to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating additional features. We then shifted our focus to implementing additional functionalities and, finally, refining styles and animations. Completing the MVP's basic functionality ahead of schedule provided us with a clearer understanding of which stretch features we could feasibly include. While basic CSS styling was manageable, the more complex animations required additional time and effort, making them a priority for the final stages.

Reflecting on our process, we recognize areas for improvement. Increased communication during remote work, particularly over weekends, would have benefited from more frequent meetings and screen-sharing sessions. Additionally, better management of our Scrum board would have streamlined our task tracking and overall workflow. These adjustments could have further enhanced our project execution and team collaboration.
