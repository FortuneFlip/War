Created by [Zhenni], [Adrian].

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, [War] is for [people of all ages]. It allows users to [play an easy-to-learn quick simple game that requires no special skills and is suitable for all ages.]

## API & React Router

This application will use the [DeckOfCards] API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [https://deckofcardsapi.com]
- API endpoint #1: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1
  - The default shuffled one deck of cards (does not include joker)
  - { "success": true, "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90", "shuffled": true, "remaining": 52 }
- API endpoint #2: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/${deckId}/draw/?count=${count}
  - To draw a card from the deck at random
  - {"success":true,"deck_id":"3oqpyindbglu","cards":[{"code":"8H","image":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/8H.png","images":{"svg":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/8H.svg","png":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/8H.png"},"value":"8","suit":"HEARTS"},{"code":"QC","image":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/QC.png","images":{"svg":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/QC.svg","png":"https://deckofcardsapi.com/static/img/QC.png"},"value":"QUEEN","suit":"CLUBS"}],"remaining":50}
- API endpoint #3: https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/${deckId}/shuffle/
  - This allows us to reshuffle the deck when we want a new game to be played
  - {"success": true,
    "deck_id": "3p40paa87x90",
    "shuffled": true,
    "remaining": 52}

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`
